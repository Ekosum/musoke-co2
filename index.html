      <h2>My First Webpages ever</h2>
        <p>This is the first  time I am dealing with HTML and these are my webpages that
          that i have created. I still undecided on what I should major in; I am hoping this class
          can help me figure that part out. I want to learn how webpages work and all there is to
          know about web creation and this will hopefully help me make my decision.
        </p>
      <h3>Progress in the class</h3>
        <p>
          Things are not to bad as they were for me in the beginning of this class. I have learnt
          alot of stuff that I didn't know in the beginning. I am happy with my progress this far
          into the coarse.
          I made my mind up and I am going to major in web development an excited to learn more
          and better my knowledge. Still have alot to learn to learn but I will get there step by step.
          A man once said "Akwta empola atuuka wala" meaning a person who is patient will get to places.
          That being me in this case.
